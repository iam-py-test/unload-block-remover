# unload-block-remover
A browser extension to prevent websites from annoying you with 'Are you sure you want to leave'.<br>
This was inspired by a comment made in https://twit.tv/shows/security-now/episodes/842 about how annoying these alerts are<br>

### Security benifits
Some scam and browser-hijack websites use `window.onbeforeunload` to block you from exiting them. This extension stops them, while allowing safe sites to still alert you about unsaved content
